.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Produces output according to format.

.SH FORMAT SPECIFIERS
       The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in
       its initial shift state, if any.  The format string is composed of
       zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are
       copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion
       specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more
       subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is introduced
       by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.
